Reverse video and audio stream *(optional)*.

Required [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

Optional [SoX](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/) (need to reverse audio, if you will compare it)

Should be added in **%Path%** for short using (just `ffmpeg`, rather than `C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe`, same with SoX)

# Usage
```BReverse [path-to-media]```

If you run without arguments, you need to type path in console.

**`! Important note !`**
At this version I recommend delete all spaces in name (use "_") and brackets ("(", ")")
