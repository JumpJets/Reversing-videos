# Reversing-videos
Reverse video and audio stream *(optional)*.

Required [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

Should be added in **%Path%** for short using (just `ffmpeg`, rather than `C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe`)

# Usage
```BReverse [path-to-media]```

If you run without arguments, you need to type path in console.

**`! Important note !`**
At this version I recommend delete all spaces in name (use "_") and brackets ("(", ")")
